# carmina

Carmina is a Clojure library which facilitates algorithmic musical composition.

I created these functions while studying under [Dr. Rodney Waschka II](http://www.waschka.info/)
in ARS06 (Music Composition with Computers). I used some of the Sythns on my 
[final project](https://coalglazer.bandcamp.com/track/thebes).
